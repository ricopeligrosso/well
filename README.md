# THE GREEN HAT MANIFESTO

## What This Is

A declaration for a global transition to a well-being society.

A well-being society guarantees human dignity while staying within planetary limits.  
Economic activity exists to serve people and the planet—not the other way around.

Green Hat Hackers are a decentralized, anonymous collective.  
No leaders. No owners. No profit motive.
